Lesson 12
create voting API via Express.js routes, using MySQL shell to connect to MySQL 
server to create database and table, then use MySQL shell to perform CRUD operations

check mysql with `mysql --version`

Database: collection of interrelated data, stored in one+ tables related to each other
Table: compsed of rows and columns. column = field, row = record
Query: request for data from database table(s)

check to make sure database doesn't exist with `show databases;`

Start by creating the database with opening MySQL shell with `mysql -u root -p`
after logging in, `mysql>` will show up confirming we are in the shell
    here we can CRUD

create database with the following: `CREATE DATABASE <database name>;`
    SQL convention with all caps helps to differentiate from identifiers like names of
    databases, tables, columns. note: identifiers are case sensitive so a database named
    `elections` will be different from `Elections`
    semicolon must be used to end command or else new command will continue from 
    previous command

select database with: `USE <database name>`

after creating and selecting database, then create table inside that database
`CREATE TABLE <table name>`

{
review the following: 
`CREATE TABLE candidates (
  id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  industry_connected BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);`

everything inside `( )` lists details of each column. column names cannot contain spaces,
    and are normally lowercase. each column is seperated by a comma.
datatypes follow column names. 
theoretically since each record could be as long as a book, should limit the number of chars
    being inputted. therefore `30` inside `VARCHAR(30)` to limit input to 30 characters
each table should have an id, especially if it contains unique records. id is designated using 
    the `PRIMARY KEY` and `AUTO_INCREMENT` attributes. `PRIMARY KEY` states each value 
    in column must be unique for each record in the table. Can also be used to link tables 
    together. `AUTO_INCREMENT`` increments each successive row and assigns a new value 
    to `id`. 
        each table can only have one `PRIMARY KEY`
    `NOT NULL` means column must contain a value. so if trying to insert a record into
        `candidates` column with missing values, database will not allow the addition
        note: since `PRIMARY KEY` column must contain a value by definition, does not
            require `NOT NULL` explicitly
}

after creating table, can verify with `DESCRIBE candidates;`
    this describes tables fields and field attributes without table's data/records

{
SQL statements that will input/load data to table: 
    `INSERT INTO candidates (first_name, last_name, industry_connected)
    VALUES ('Ronald', 'Firbank', 1);`

NOTE: the varchar characters must be surrounded by ' ' since they are strings
}

to verify the data added, `SELECT * FROM <table name>;`

adding multiple inserts:
    `INSERT INTO candidates (first_name, last_name, industry_connected)
    VALUES
        ('Virginia', 'Woolf', 1),
        ('Piers', 'Gaveston', 0),
        ('Charles', 'LeRoi', 1),
        ('Katherine', 'Mansfield', 1),
        ('Dora', 'Carrington', 0),
        ('Edward', 'Bellamy', 0),
        ('Montague', 'Summers', 1),
        ('Octavia', 'Butler', 1),
        ('Unica', 'Zurn', 1);`

select specific columns: `SELECT first_name, last_name FROM candidates;`
selectively filtering data can be done with `WHEN` clause:
    `SELECT first_name, industry_connected
    FROM candidates
    WHERE industry_connected = 1;`
filter data to only show `industry_connected` with a value of 1
another example, but to select a specific row:
    `SELECT first_name, last_name, industry_connected
    FROM candidates
    WHERE id = 5;`

to save and share these databases, create `./db/db.sql` and `./db/schema.sql`
    create `seeds.sql` for data insertion
    in `db.sql`, create database and use it the same as above
    in `schema.sql` create table with columns the same as above
        since we already have this table created in the shell, need to delete (DROP) the 
        database via shell command: `DROP DATABASE election;`

now to recreate `election` database or to execute script files:    `source db/db.sql`
next, create table and columns from `schema.sql` with:      `source db/schema.sql`
check with: `DESCRIBE candidates;`

now create `./db/seeds.sql` and populate candidates table with data
execute file with: `source db/seeds.sql`
    check with: `SELECT * FROM candidates;`

can change table with the `UPDATE` keyword, ex:
    `UPDATE candidates
    SET industry_connected = 1
    WHERE id = 3;`

to delete data, use `DELETE FROM` keywords, ex:
    `DELETE FROM candidates
    WHERE first_name = "Montague";`
when deleting, ID that is being autogenerated will not change for the rows following the 
row that was deleted. and when new rows are added, they will continue from the last row.
this way there will not be duplicate id's

        side note: enter `quit` in MySQL shell to exit. type `help` in MySQL for more commands

12.2
- going to initialize Node.js, connect it to MySQL, then execute SQL queries in Express.js
    api routes using MySQL methods. API endpoints will be tested in insomnia.

initialize node with `npm init --y`, then create `.gitignore` and include `node_modules/`
install express and mysql2 with `npm install express mysql2'
    mysql2 will allow us to connect express API routes to MySQL database and execute SQL 
    commands to perform CRUD operations
install jest with `npm install jest --save-dev`, then change inside package.json to "test": "jest"

**new: to start express.js server, update `scripts` code in `package.json` to match:
`"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "start": "node server.js"
},`

run MySQL shell: `mysql -u root -p`
check database: `SHOW DATABASES;` then select db with `USE election;`
check table: `SHOW TABLES;` then check if data present with `SELECT * FROM candidates;`
    if any errors, then create and start db again with `source db/db.sql`

create express.js server:
create server.js in root, define express, add port, middleware, and app.listen
create `app.get(`) for the root directory `('/', () => { })` then `npm start` and load 
    `localhost:PORT` to test that server is working and connection is established

create `app.use()` for 404 message (can remove `app.get()` for directory since connection made)

load `mysql2` into server with `const mysql = require('mysql2');`

// Connect to database
const db = mysql.createConnection(
  {
    host: 'localhost',
    // Your MySQL username,
    user: 'root',
    // Your MySQL password
    password: '',
    database: 'election'
  },
  console.log('Connected to the election database.')
);

`db.query()` runs SQL query and executes callback

create API endpoint to retrieve all candidates from `candidates` table
front end can loop and parse object to display list of candidate names
